## Machine Learning Techniques

### Sentiment Classification

Used **TF-IDF** for text feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classifying review sentiment.

### Topic Modeling

Applied:

* **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**
* **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**

to identify major topics and patterns within the reviews.

### Semantic Search

Used **Sentence Transformers** to generate text embeddings and perform semantic similarity search across reviews.

## Dataset

The project uses **8,530 Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews** for NLP analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-github-repository-url>
cd nlp-text-analytics

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t nlp-text-analytics .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 nlp-text-analytics
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```
